# Aspect Ratio+
A simple extension for Stable Diffusion WebUI that adds a dropdown of aspect ratios and automatically maintains proportions when changing width/height.

## Features
- JavaScript aspect ratio controls
  - Adds a dropdown of configurable aspect ratios, which will auto-scale the dimensions
  - If "Lock/üîí" is selected, the aspect ratio of the current dimensions will be kept
  - If "Image/üñºÔ∏è" is selected, the aspect ratio of the current image will be kept (img2img only)
  - If you click the "Swap/‚áÖ" button, the current dimensions will swap, and the aspect ratios will flip accordingly
